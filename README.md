# Summary
This application leverages OBS (https://obsproject.com/). OBS is an open source software that enables you to capture audio and video. I used the AWS Amplify CLI to make a custom OBS configuration that broadcasts what OBS captures to my AWS Amplify Cloud Stack. I control the broadcast through the AWS Amplify CLI locally. I am using this application to livestream anything I want from my desktop. Effectively deploying my own personal Twitch. This app is being used for movie nights hosted on the Clubhouse social media app. I am currently working with directors to premiere unreleased films and also show (with permission) already released films to parties consisting of anywhere between 50 & thousands of simultaneous viewers.
